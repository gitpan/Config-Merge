Revision history for Perl extension Config::Merge.

0.02  Sat May 24 21:13:15 2003
    The regresion test failed if Config::General is not installed, but this
    was not supposed to happen, since Config::General is for testing only.
    The test should even skip if Config::General is not installed. This bug
    existed because I used use() instead of require(). Fixed.
